# Singly Linked List

## Overview
A Singly Linked List is a fundamental data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (link or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This implementation provides various operations to manipulate the linked list.

## Usage

### Insertion
To add elements to the list:

- Insert element at the beginning:
    ```c
    insertAtBeginning(list, data);
    ```

- Insert element at the end:
    ```c
    insertAtEnd(list, data);
    ```

- Insert element at a specific position:
    ```c
    insertAtPosition(list, data, position);
    ```

### Deletion
To remove elements from the list:

- Remove element from the beginning:
    ```c
    deleteFromBeginning(list);
    ```

- Remove element from the end:
    ```c
    deleteFromEnd(list);
    ```

- Remove element from a specific position:
    ```c
    deleteAtPosition(list, position);
    ```

### Traversal
To iterate through the list:

```c
