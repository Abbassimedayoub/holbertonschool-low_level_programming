## Handling Command-Line Arguments in C and C++

In C and C++ programming, `argc` and `argv` are commonly used to manage command-line arguments when running a program. These parameters are typically located in the `main` function, which serves as the entry point of a C or C++ program. 

### `argc` (Argument Count):

- `argc` is an integer variable that signifies the count of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the program's name itself.
- It always has a minimum value of 1 because the program's name is considered the first argument.
- The system automatically sets the value of `argc` when the program is initiated, providing information on how many command-line arguments were provided.

### `argv` (Argument Vector):

- `argv` is a pointer to an array of character pointers (strings) that represents the actual command-line arguments.
- Each element of the `argv` array is a C-style string, which is a null-terminated character array. Typically, `argv[0]` contains the program's name.
- Additional command-line arguments are stored in `argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, and so on.
- The `argv[argc]` element is always a null pointer, marking the end of the array.

Here's a basic example of how `argc` and `argv` are used in a C or C++ program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Program name: %s\n", argv[0]);

    if (argc > 1) {
        printf("Arguments provided:\n");
        for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
            printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
        }
    } else {
        printf("No additional arguments provided.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
